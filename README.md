# Deep Q-Learning

Implementation of a simple game playing agent using Deep Q-learning and experience replay.

The project is based upon the following libraries:
 * OpenAI Gym
 * Tensorflow. 

The project is built upon ideas presented in ['Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learninng'](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602.pdf).

Detailed documentation cominng soon. ;)
